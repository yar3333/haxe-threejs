# Three.js externs for Haxe  #

The aim of this library - fully automated (regex-based) conversion from TypeScript to Haxe.

 * For conversion used [refactor](http://lib.haxe.org/p/refactor) haxe library.
 * Original typescript code: [three.d.ts](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/three/index.d.ts).


### How to update library ###

 * Install refactor library:
	```shell
	haxelib install refactor
	```
 * Edit Makefile and change ThreeJS version to desired at the `TAG = rXX` line.
 * Run in the root repo's folder (in my case I use MinGW on Windows):
	```shell
	make rebuild
	```
 * Manually check files. Documentator helps your:
	* edit `TAG = rXX` line in `Makefile`
	* run `make native-js`
	* goto `documentator/bin` and run `ThreejsDocumentator.exe`
	* after correcting typescript, run `make rebuild` again


### Project structure

Folders:

 * native-ts - original typescript files (automatically downloaded if not exist - git must be installed);
 * raw - one big haxe file - result of the conversion TypeScript->Haxe;
 * manual - manually created files (copied to library at final step);
 * unused - files from [labe-me](https://github.com/labe-me/haxe-three.js) project, which not exists in current externs (need to check them in future);
 * documentator - C# application to help writing documentation and fix typescript;
 * native-js - original three.js files (used by documentator only).

Files:

 * postprocess.rules - edit this to fix Float->Int;
 * extract_classes.rules - regexs to find classes/interfaces (used to split raw haxe file to separate class files);
 * extract_vars.rules - regexs to find & save exported vars;
 * postprocess_vars.rules - regexs to process exported vars files.
